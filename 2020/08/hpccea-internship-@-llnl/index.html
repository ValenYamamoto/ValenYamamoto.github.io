(LLNL) as a part of the High Performance Computing Cluster Engineering Academy
(HPCCEA) program. As a part of this program, I got to experience how the computing division
of one the world&rsquo;s pioneering supercomputing centers was run. I worked on
installing computing nodes, writing bash scripts and eventually using Ansible to
automate the proces of bring up a new node. I was first exposed to and got
pretty proficient in usingn the Linux command line interface, as when the nodes
were first spun up, the command line was the only way to interface with it. Our
scripts to automate the installation process can be found at the following
Github Repository:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/LLNL/HPCCEA>HPCCEA Github Repository</a></p><p>In addition to working on the cluster, I spent a majority of my time working on
a project optimizing matrix multiplication algorithms for parallel computing
environments. I worked with the naive and strassen algorithms, parallelizing
them using the pthreads library and the openMP interface in C. In addition to
distributing the workload to decrease the running time, I also used vector
instructions specific to the Intel Sandy Bridge architecture to do SIMD dot
products for additional speedup.</p><p>To characterize the behavior of both algorithms as the problem size increased, I
read Intel&rsquo;s Model Specific Registers (MSRs) to get low level information on
each run&rsquo;s execution&ndash;clock cycles, instructions executed, L1/L2 cache hits and
misses. Using this data from the MSRs, I was able to use roofline analysis to
determine at what input sizes the algorithms were compute bounds and when they
became memory bound. I later use Intel&rsquo;s PIN tools to count the times individual
instructions were called to verify that no extraneous instructions were being
issued.</p><p>For the naive matrix multiplication algorithm, the algorithm becomes
increasingly more memory bound when the input size is greater than around 1000.
In order to combat this, I would pull several values ahead into the cache to
have faster memory reads. This significantly decreased the execution time.</p><p><img src=/images/naive_optimization.png alt="naive optimization graph"></p><p>For the strassen algorithm for an nxn matrix, I used the n=2 input case as the
base case for the recursion and then applied Intel Intrinsics vector
instructions.</p><p><img src=/images/strassen_instrinsics.png alt="Strassen optimization graph"></p><p>In the end, a comparison showed that the strassen algorithm only had a better
performance than the naive algorithm when the input size was greater than 2^12
or 4096. This is because although the strassen algorithm has a better time
complexity than the naive algorithm, the hidden constant in the Big-O is very
large.</p><p><img src=/images/naive_strassen_comparison.png alt=comparison></p><p>For a more through explanation of my findings, see the following Github
repository for more graphs as well as the code to generate those results:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/ValenYamamoto/matrix-multiply-optimization>Matrix Multiply Optimization</a></p></section></article><section class=read-more><div class=read-more-item><span class=read-more-item-dim>Recent</span><h2 class="post-list__post-title post-title"><a href=/2020/10/neural-networks-with-pytorch-workshop/ title="link to Neural Networks with PyTorch Workshop">Neural Networks with PyTorch Workshop</a></h2><p class=excerpt>Github Repository
