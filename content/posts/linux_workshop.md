All engineers will eventually have to use the Linux command line either on the
job or in classes; however, the command line is barely taught in classes. While
a rudimentary understanding of the command line is needed to get most tasks
done, knowing some additional tips and tricks can make work much easier and
faster. The goal of the workshop was to introduce the Linux command line
interface as well as common commands that all engineers should know.

This workshop covers the following:
* Intro to Linux OS
* Linux filesystem and traversing the directory structure
* Managing file permissions
* Pipes and redirects
* grep, find
* aliasing
* vim
* tmux
