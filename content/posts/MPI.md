After my internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I decided to
write on workshop on MPI for parallel programming. As large servers become more
ubiquitous in most computer science workplaces, being able to write and execute
multi-processor programs becomes more useful and feasible.

This workshop covers the following concepts:
* blocking/non-blocking sends/receives
* openMPI for C
* mpi4py for Python
* buffers
* Collective Communication Routinues

This workshop also has some Google Colab notebooks for participants to follow
along with:
* [C](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12-AmHyu3AvMKvNoYE4xiOlxOnt_k7CcQ?usp=sharing)
* [Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DmPziA4KuqG6Z9EwsM07X5OYod_Wq2SF?usp=sharing)
