Check out the first dotfiles workshop [here]({{< ref "linux_dotfiles.md" >}})

For the second time around, I've added some more information on topics I feel
would be useful for engineering students who have to sign into the servers for
our assignments.

The additional information added to this workshop:
* Aliasing
* .vim folder and ftplugins
* SSH keys and passwordless ssh sign in, .ssh folder
* The linux filesystem (inodes, hardlinks vs. softlinks)
