Rerunning last year&amp;rsquo;s workshop, I realized that I did not write down any information on what I said last year. So this year, I have made a powerpoint presentation to go with the workshop.
Other than the presentation, the workshop is mostly unchanged.</description></item><item><title>Linux Dotfiles Workshop (Part 2)</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/04/linux-dotfiles-workshop-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 20:45:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/04/linux-dotfiles-workshop-part-2/</guid><description>Github Repository
For the second time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve added some more information on topics I feel would be useful for engineering students who have to sign into the servers for our assignments.
The additional information added to this workshop:
Aliasing .vim folder and ftplugins SSH keys and passwordless ssh sign in, .ssh folder The linux filesystem (inodes, hardlinks vs. softlinks)</description></item><item><title>Linux Command Line Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/10/linux-command-line-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 20:38:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/10/linux-command-line-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
All engineers will eventually have to use the Linux command line either on the job or in classes; however, the command line is barely taught in classes. While a rudimentary understanding of the command line is needed to get most tasks done, knowing some additional tips and tricks can make work much easier and faster. The goal of the workshop was to introduce the Linux command line interface as well as common commands that all engineers should know.</description></item><item><title>Linux Dotfiles Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/05/linux-dotfiles-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 20:45:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/05/linux-dotfiles-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
Everyone in engineering has to use a Linux terminal once in a while. Why not customize your experience? This workshop was conceived as a fast, easy workshop to run during midterms while also giving useful information on how to increase productivity in the shell environment.
This workshop covers the following topics:
hidden files in Linux .vimrc file for vim settings .bashrc for shell settings custom bash prompts aliases .</description></item><item><title>HPCCEA Internship @ LLNL</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/08/hpccea-internship-llnl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 20:46:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/08/hpccea-internship-llnl/</guid><description>For my first internship, I worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) as a part of the High Performance Computing Cluster Engineering Academy (HPCCEA) program. As a part of this program, I got to experience how the computing division of one the world&amp;rsquo;s pioneering supercomputing centers was run. I worked on installing computing nodes, writing bash scripts and eventually using Ansible to automate the proces of bring up a new node.</description></item></channel></rss>
