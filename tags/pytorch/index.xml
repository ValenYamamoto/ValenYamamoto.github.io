For my first workshop for the IEEE@UCI, I wanted to talk about something I found interesting, so I decided to do a workshop on neural networks. Because of its recently growing popularity, most engineering students have heard of neural networks, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily understand how they work.
My goal with this workshop was to both introduce people to the math behind neural networks and to let people have hands-on practice composing and training a neural network.</description></item></channel></rss>
