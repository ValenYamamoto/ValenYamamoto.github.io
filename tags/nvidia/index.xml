Since we still had those 15 Jetson Nanos (thanks NVIDIA!), we should probably do something more with them. And what better to do with them than computer vision.
This workshop covers the following concepts:
Convolution-based image processing kernels Gaussian, Low-pass blurs Sobel operators/ high pass filters Edge detection with Canny Edge Detector VPI Viewing CSI Cameras from the Jetson PyTorch for utilizing the GPU Flask website for streaming video</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Internship @ LLNL</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/11/machine-learning-internship-llnl/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 20:46:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/11/machine-learning-internship-llnl/</guid><description>My second summer internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) focused on comparing machine learning inference performance on novel AI hardware accelerators from Samba Nova and Cerebras to NVIDIA GPUs. I was working with a autoencoder model used to material interface reconstruction (MIR) for multi-material hydrodynamics codes. The neural network was proposed as an alternative to current solution PLIC: the neural network provided much smoother, continuous boundaries than PLIC, which could only give linear approximations.</description></item></channel></rss>
