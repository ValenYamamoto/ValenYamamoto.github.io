Rerunning last year&amp;rsquo;s workshop, I realized that I did not write down any information on what I said last year. So this year, I have made a powerpoint presentation to go with the workshop.
Other than the presentation, the workshop is mostly unchanged.</description></item><item><title>Computer Vision with the Jetson Nano Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/05/computer-vision-with-the-jetson-nano-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 20:45:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/05/computer-vision-with-the-jetson-nano-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
Since we still had those 15 Jetson Nanos (thanks NVIDIA!), we should probably do something more with them. And what better to do with them than computer vision.
This workshop covers the following concepts:
Convolution-based image processing kernels Gaussian, Low-pass blurs Sobel operators/ high pass filters Edge detection with Canny Edge Detector VPI Viewing CSI Cameras from the Jetson PyTorch for utilizing the GPU Flask website for streaming video</description></item><item><title>Linux Dotfiles Workshop (Part 2)</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/04/linux-dotfiles-workshop-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 20:45:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2022/04/linux-dotfiles-workshop-part-2/</guid><description>Github Repository
For the second time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve added some more information on topics I feel would be useful for engineering students who have to sign into the servers for our assignments.
The additional information added to this workshop:
Aliasing .vim folder and ftplugins SSH keys and passwordless ssh sign in, .ssh folder The linux filesystem (inodes, hardlinks vs. softlinks)</description></item><item><title>Linux Command Line Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/10/linux-command-line-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 20:38:24 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/10/linux-command-line-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
All engineers will eventually have to use the Linux command line either on the job or in classes; however, the command line is barely taught in classes. While a rudimentary understanding of the command line is needed to get most tasks done, knowing some additional tips and tricks can make work much easier and faster. The goal of the workshop was to introduce the Linux command line interface as well as common commands that all engineers should know.</description></item><item><title>Linux Dotfiles Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/05/linux-dotfiles-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 20:45:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/05/linux-dotfiles-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
Everyone in engineering has to use a Linux terminal once in a while. Why not customize your experience? This workshop was conceived as a fast, easy workshop to run during midterms while also giving useful information on how to increase productivity in the shell environment.
This workshop covers the following topics:
hidden files in Linux .vimrc file for vim settings .bashrc for shell settings custom bash prompts aliases .</description></item><item><title>Python Scripts for Parsing SPICE Output: A Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/04/python-scripts-for-parsing-spice-output-a-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:46:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/04/python-scripts-for-parsing-spice-output-a-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
Python is particularly useful for writing quick scripts. I find myself reaching for Python whenever I need to parse output into more readable/processable forms like csv files or pandas DataFrames. Engineering students at UCI don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time learning Python, so I thought this would be a particularly useful exercise.
This workshop goes through a program to parse PSPICE output and allows the user to either output a csv version of the output or to pick out particular components with voltages or currents above a specified threshold.</description></item><item><title>MPI Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/11/mpi-workshop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 20:46:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/11/mpi-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
After my internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I decided to write on workshop on MPI for parallel programming. As large servers become more ubiquitous in most computer science workplaces, being able to write and execute multi-processor programs becomes more useful and feasible.
This workshop covers the following concepts:
blocking/non-blocking sends/receives openMPI for C mpi4py for Python buffers Collective Communication Routinues This workshop also has some Google Colab notebooks for participants to follow along with:</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks with PyTorch Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/10/neural-networks-with-pytorch-workshop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 20:46:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/10/neural-networks-with-pytorch-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
For my first workshop for the IEEE@UCI, I wanted to talk about something I found interesting, so I decided to do a workshop on neural networks. Because of its recently growing popularity, most engineering students have heard of neural networks, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily understand how they work.
My goal with this workshop was to both introduce people to the math behind neural networks and to let people have hands-on practice composing and training a neural network.</description></item></channel></rss>
