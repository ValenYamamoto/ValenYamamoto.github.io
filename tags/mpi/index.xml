After my internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I decided to write on workshop on MPI for parallel programming. As large servers become more ubiquitous in most computer science workplaces, being able to write and execute multi-processor programs becomes more useful and feasible.
This workshop covers the following concepts:
blocking/non-blocking sends/receives openMPI for C mpi4py for Python buffers Collective Communication Routinues This workshop also has some Google Colab notebooks for participants to follow along with:</description></item><item><title>HPCCEA Internship @ LLNL</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/08/hpccea-internship-llnl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 20:46:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2020/08/hpccea-internship-llnl/</guid><description>For my first internship, I worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) as a part of the High Performance Computing Cluster Engineering Academy (HPCCEA) program. As a part of this program, I got to experience how the computing division of one the world&amp;rsquo;s pioneering supercomputing centers was run. I worked on installing computing nodes, writing bash scripts and eventually using Ansible to automate the proces of bring up a new node.</description></item></channel></rss>
