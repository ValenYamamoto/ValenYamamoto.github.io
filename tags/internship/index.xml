I was working with a autoencoder model used to material interface reconstruction (MIR) for multi-material hydrodynamics codes. The neural network was proposed as an alternative to current solution PLIC: the neural network provided much smoother, continuous boundaries than PLIC, which could only give linear approximations.</description></item></channel></rss>
