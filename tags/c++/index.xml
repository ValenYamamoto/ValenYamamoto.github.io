Ever since I started learning PyTorch, I have been fascinated by the automatic gradient feature. In order to further understand it, I decided I would try to write my own version. At the time, I was also taking a C++ class, so I decided to both learn about autograd and study for my finals. (As well as do the required project to initiate into IEEE-HKN)
This program dynamically constructs a computation graph as operations are done.</description></item></channel></rss>
