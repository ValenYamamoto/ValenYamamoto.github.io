Usually in motion planning, paths are smoothed to make corners into curves for less jerky motion; however, for space robotics, planners try to send the least amount of data through space to the rovers so the minimal number of viapoints is preferred. So instead of smoothing the RRT-generated paths, I spent the majority of my time simplifying the paths to the smallest number of viapoints.</description></item><item><title>Python Scripts for Parsing SPICE Output: A Workshop</title><link>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/04/python-scripts-for-parsing-spice-output-a-workshop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:46:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ValenYamamoto.github.io/2021/04/python-scripts-for-parsing-spice-output-a-workshop/</guid><description>Github Repository
Python is particularly useful for writing quick scripts. I find myself reaching for Python whenever I need to parse output into more readable/processable forms like csv files or pandas DataFrames. Engineering students at UCI don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time learning Python, so I thought this would be a particularly useful exercise.
This workshop goes through a program to parse PSPICE output and allows the user to either output a csv version of the output or to pick out particular components with voltages or currents above a specified threshold.</description></item></channel></rss>
