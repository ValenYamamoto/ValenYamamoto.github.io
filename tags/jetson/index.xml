Since we still had those 15 Jetson Nanos (thanks NVIDIA!), we should probably do something more with them. And what better to do with them than computer vision.
This workshop covers the following concepts:
Convolution-based image processing kernels Gaussian, Low-pass blurs Sobel operators/ high pass filters Edge detection with Canny Edge Detector VPI Viewing CSI Cameras from the Jetson PyTorch for utilizing the GPU Flask website for streaming video</description></item></channel></rss>
